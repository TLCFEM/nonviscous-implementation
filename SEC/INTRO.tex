\section{Introduction}
The equation of motion of nonviscously damped systems can be, conventionally, expressed as an integro-differential equation, namely, for elastic linear single-degree-of-freedom systems,
\begin{gather}\label{eq:single_eom}
m\ddot{u}\left(t\right)+\left(g*\dot{u}\right)\left(t\right)+ku\left(t\right)=p\left(t\right),
\end{gather}
where $u(t)$ denotes the displacement, $\dot{(\cdot)}$ denotes time derivative, and $g=g(t)$ is the kernel function. Various forms have been proposed, see a summary by \citet[][Table 1.1]{Adhikari2014}.

The convolution term in \eqsref{eq:single_eom} can be expressed in integral form such that
\begin{gather}\label{eq:conv}
\left(g*\dot{u}\right)\left(t\right)=\int_0^tg\left(t-\tau\right)\dot{u}\left(\tau\right)\md{\tau}.
\end{gather}
Approaches to compute (or approximate, depending on one's perspective) \eqsref{eq:conv} can be divided into two main categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time Domain Methods\\
Since $g(t)$ is known, \eqsref{eq:conv} can be numerically integrated such that
\begin{gather}
\int_0^Tg\left(T-\tau\right)\dot{u}\left(\tau\right)\md{\tau}\approx\sum_i^n\omega_ig\left(T-t_i\right)\dot{u}\left(t_i\right),
\end{gather}
where $t_i=\left\{t_0,t_1,t_2,\cdots,t_n\right\}\in[0,T]$ that can be either evenly or unevenly spaced, and $\omega_i$ is the corresponding integration weight, assuming $\dot{u}(t_i)$ is already obtained up to a given time $T$ at each sampling point $t_i$. If the exact $\dot{u}(t_i)$ is not available, approximations (linear interpolation, weighted sum, etc.) based on adjacent known values are often adopted.

Such a direct approach is intuitive and has been discussed in the existing literature. The simplest integration one can come up with is the rectangle rule, which is used in the implementation by \citet{Puthanpurayil2014}. Noting that the rectangle rule possesses the lowest order of accuracy possible, it effectively yields low-order overall accuracy --- even when the adopted time integration method is second-order accurate. To improve, trapezoidal rule \citep{Liu2014} and Simpson's rules can be used \citep{Shen2019}. If necessary, other high-order Newton--Cotes rules can also be adopted. However, since most time integration methods (for response history analysis) are of second order, Simpson's rules would suffice.

No matter how the convolution term is integrated, it is inevitable to perform numerical integration of $(g*\dot{u})(t)$ for \textbf{each} substep, which is computationally expensive. Furthermore, given the nature of convolution, most intermediate results computed in the current substep can not be reused in subsequent substeps. The exception is the values of $g(T-t_i)$ evaluated at $t_i$, which do not need to be re-evaluated if $T$ and $t_i$ satisfy certain conditions. The explicit integration also requires additional assumptions to be imposed, which may have significant impacts on the final analysis result \citep[see][]{Liu2014}.
\item Frequency Domain Methods\\
\eqsref{eq:single_eom} can be equivalently expressed in the frequency domain via Laplace transform. For some kernels, analytical solutions can be found and converted back to the time domain.
