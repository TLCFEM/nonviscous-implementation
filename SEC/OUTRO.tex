\section{Conclusions}
In this work, a performant general--purpose algorithm integrating nonviscous damping with direct time integration methods with arbitrary kernel functions is proposed.

An open source port of the VPMR algorithm is available online\footnote{https://github.com/TLCFEM/vpmr}, or alternatively, the original implementation is available in this repository\footnote{https://github.com/ZXGao97/VPMR}.

The nonviscous damping has been implemented in \texttt{suanPan} \citep{Chang2023}. All numerical models and the corresponding analytical solutions (if applicable) are available in this repository\footnote{https://github.com/TLCFEM/nonviscous-implementation}.
